OBTAIN DECISION THRESHOLDS (AFTER TRAINING)

The decision threshold `Î²` determines whether a new image can be matched to a
face image or not. If the distance between the new image embedding and the face
image embedding is below the threshold, then both images are considered similar
enough and can be matched; in other case, they are considered sufficiently
differnt to discard the math.

### FIRST ALGORITHM (TA-TR ALGORITHM)

This algorithm is called TA-TR (True accepts - True rejects algorithm)
algorithm.

For a specific threshold, the following metrics are defined:

*   Anchor-positive **T**rue **A**ccepts (**TA**): number of anchor-positive
        pairs accepted with the threshold, those anchor-positive pairs
        whose distance is lower than the threshold.
*   Anchor-negative **T**rue **R**ejects (**TR**): number of anchor-negative
        pairs rejected with the threshold, those anchor-negative pairs
        whose distance is greater than the threshold.

The optimal threshold is obtain from training triplets as that threshold
that maximizes the sum of the ratio of TA plus the ratio of TR.

SECOND ALGORITHM (RAAP-RAAN ALGORITHM)

This algorithm is called RAAP-RAAN (defined below) algorithm.

For a specific threshold, the histogram of distances is buildt and
the following two metrics are defined:

*   **R**atio of **A**rea under **A**nchor-**P**ositive true accepts (**RAAP**).
        The area under anchor-positive bins with lower distance than
        threshold distance is calculated (via integral) and dividided
        by total anchor-positive bins area to obtain the ratio.
*   **R**atio of **A**rea under **A**nchor-**N**egative true rejects (**RAAN**).
        Simmilarly, the area under anchor-ngeative bins with greater
        distance than threshold distance is calculated (via integral)
        and dividided by total anchor-negative bins area to obtain
        the ratio.

The optimal threshold is obtained from training triplets as the threshold
that maximizes the metric `RAAP*RAAN`.
